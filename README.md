# Price Movement Strength Indicator

This is a custom indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The Price Movement Strength Indicator measures the strength of price movements in the market and provides color-coded candles to visually represent the trend.

## Indicator Parameters

- BuyLevel: The percentage required for a buy signal.
- SellLevel: The percentage required for a sell signal.

## How It Works

The indicator calculates the price movement strength by comparing the current closing price with the previous closing price. If the price movement is positive, the candles are colored green. If the price movement is negative, the candles are colored red. If there is no price movement, the candles are colored black.

## Trading Signals

Based on the Price Movement Strength Indicator, trading signals can be generated. The indicator checks the last calculated price movement strength and compares it with the BuyLevel and SellLevel parameters. If the price movement strength is above the BuyLevel, a buy signal is generated. If the price movement strength is below the negative SellLevel, a sell signal is generated.

## Product Description
